DESCRIPTION: 
The E-Learning Platform UI is a multi-page frontend interface designed to simulate an online learning environment. The platform includes features such as a course listing page, a course detail page with embedded videos, and a progress tracking system to monitor completion status. The course listing page displays all available courses in a card-based layout, while the course detail page allows users to watch embedded video lessons and mark progress. A progress bar visually represents the percentage of course completion, and the UI dynamically updates as users complete lessons.

The design focuses on usability and interactivity, with responsive layouts for mobile and desktop devices. This application demonstrates the ability to create multi-page web applications, handle user interactions using JavaScript, and create visually appealing UI components. The platform can be extended to include user authentication, multiple lesson modules, and data storage for real progress tracking. This project highlights skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UI/UX design.
